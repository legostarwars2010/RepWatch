                <h2>About RepWatch</h2>
                <p>RepWatch is a civic transparency platform built to close the gap between citizens and their government. We track votes, bills, and floor actions across Congress and state legislatures, then translate them into clear, plain-English summaries so people can see exactly what their representatives are doing between election cycles.</p>
                <p>Most of us only hear about politics when it reaches the headlines or resurfaces during campaign season. But democracy happens quietly, every day, in committee rooms and floor votes that rarely make the news. RepWatch brings that process into the open.</p>
                <p>No jargon. No partisanship. No paywalls. Just the truth of how your representatives are using the power you gave them.</p>
                <p>Because democracy works best when people can see it working.</p>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>We built RepWatch because we were tired of feeling disconnected from the people who claim to represent us.</p>
                <p>Most of us don't really know what our representatives do day to day. We hear about the big votes that make the news or the polished talking points that resurface every election season, but the rest of the time, we're in the dark. The reality is, government doesn't stop when coverage does. Deals are made. Bills are passed. Promises are broken. And we only find out long after it matters.</p>
                <p>That disconnect isn't apathy; it's exhaustion. It's the feeling of being spoken for, but never really heard.</p>
                <p>We started RepWatch because we believe representation should mean something again. It should mean transparency, honesty, and accountability. It should mean we can see what's being done in our name every day, not just when it's politically convenient.</p>
                <p>This isn't about partisanship or outrage. It's about ownership. It's about giving people the clarity and confidence to stay informed, to stay engaged, and to take part in the system that shapes their lives.</p>
                <p>Because real democracy doesn't happen every two or four years. It happens every single day, in the choices made by people we've trusted to lead.</p>
                <p>We built RepWatch to help rebuild that trust, one informed citizen at a time.</p>
